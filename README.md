The Denver Crime Analysis Project aims to create a predictive model of crime using two data sets available from the City of Denver Open Data Catalog, the first being the reported crime statistics and the second being the 2010 Census Data. Both data sets use neighborhood information which will act as the primary key linking the two data sets enabling a good analysis and modeling.

From the City of Denver Open Data Catalog (located @ https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-crime) this dataset includes criminal offenses in the City and County of Denver for the previous five calendar years plus the current year to date. The data is based on the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) which includes all victims of person crimes and all crimes within an incident. These data are dynamic, which allows for additions, deletions and/or modifications at any time, resulting in more accurate information in the database. Due to continuous data entry, the number of records in subsequent extractions are subject to change. Crime data is updated Monday through Friday.

Also from the City of Denver Open Data Catalog (located @ https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-census-neighborhood-demographics-2010) is a dataset which includes layers from Community Planning and Development with additional demographic information compiled from the 2010 US Census. The City of Denver reports that every effort was made to ensure that blocks were assigned to their proper neighborhoods, due to geographic problems inherent in the original 2010 census block data, errors may exist. This data set includes the housing and population data from redistricting file P.L. 94-171 of the 2010 census. The data-set does not contain data for any enclaves administered by other jurisdictions that are located within the City and County of Denver's boundary.
