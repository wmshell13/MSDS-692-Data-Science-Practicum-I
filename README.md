The Denver Crime Analysis Project aims to create a predictive model of crime using two data sets available from the City of Denver Open Data Catalog, the first being the reported crime statistics and the second being the 2010 Census Data. Both data sets use neighborhood information which will act as the primary key linking the two data sets enabling a good analysis and modeling.
